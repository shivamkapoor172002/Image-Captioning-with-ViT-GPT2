# Image Captioning with ViT-GPT2

Welcome to the Image Captioning with ViT-GPT2 project, a cutting-edge tool that combines the power of computer vision and natural language processing to generate captions for your images. This application utilizes a pretrained Vision Encoder-Decoder model to provide contextually relevant and descriptive captions for your uploaded images.

## Overview

Image captioning is a fascinating intersection of computer vision and NLP, enabling you to extract meaningful insights from visual content. Whether you're looking to enhance the accessibility of images, improve SEO, or simply add context to your image collections, this application simplifies the process of generating image captions.

## How It Works

1. **Upload an Image**: Select an image by uploading it through the user-friendly interface.

2. **Generate Caption**: Click the "Generate Caption" button to initiate the captioning process.

3. **View Caption**: Within seconds, the application generates a descriptive caption for the uploaded image, providing you with valuable insights.

This application leverages the power of a pretrained Vision Encoder-Decoder model, ViT-GPT2, fine-tuned for image captioning. The model is designed to understand the content of images and generate human-like captions that capture the essence of the visual information.

## Device Agnostic

The application is device-agnostic, making use of either GPU or CPU based on availability. This ensures efficient and quick processing of image caption generation.

## Customization

You can customize the image captioning process by adjusting parameters such as the maximum caption length and the number of beams used for generation. This gives you fine-grained control over the quality and style of the generated captions.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, you'll need to install Streamlit and the Transformers library from Hugging Face. You can explore different pretrained models and fine-tune them to match your specific image captioning needs.

## Contribute and Enhance

This project is open to contributions and enhancements. You can improve the user interface, integrate more advanced image captioning models, or adapt it for specific applications and industries.

## License

This project is open-source and available under the MIT License, allowing you to use, modify, and distribute it according to your requirements.
